Based on yolov3 target detection network, we make our own data set.

It can basically achieve the static detection of the opponent's target.

Using transfer learning, the training speed is accelerated and the detection accuracy is improved.

It can locate single target gesture accurately, but there are still some problems in gesture classification.
